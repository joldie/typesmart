# TypeSmart

Web app for practicing typing fast while learning about topics from Wikipedia.

## Description

Topics are drawn from the Wikipedia list of "[vital articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles)" (~1000 important articles that every Wikipedia should include).

Currently only English topics available. Non-english text characters are transliterated into US-ASCII to allow test to proceed, despite known deficiencies in accurateness of resulting translation.

Written in JS (Vue.js), HTML5 and CSS3 (Sass).
