# To Do

## High priority

- [ ] Calculated, display typing words per minute

## Medium priority

- [ ] UX: Implement autocomplete for search (to avoid landing on disambiguation pages)
- [ ] UX: Enable searching by different languages (incl. basic english)
- [ ] Refactor App.vue code - make SearchForm.vue component
- [ ] UX: Limit number of sentences/words in text (allow user to adjust)
- [ ] UX: Remove special characters from text

## Low priority

- [ ] Enable fetching text from other MediaWiki sites, e.g. WikiQuote
- [ ] User login, save results, etc
- [ ] Post results to social media
- [ ] Compete against other users / fixed speed / your old scores
- [ ] Add "random topic" button (see answer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33614492/wikipedia-api-get-random-pages)
- [ ] Show race car (or similar) along track as visual cue for speed
